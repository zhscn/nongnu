@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

swsw provides a minor mode for switching to windows using IDs assigned to them
automatically. It's implementation is simple and extensible, providing various
advanced customization features for users, while keeping the code base small
and easy to hack on.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

swsw can be installed from NonGNU ELPA:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x package-install RET swsw RET}
@end table

@menu
* Installing a release::
* Installing from the Git repository::
@end menu

@node Installing a release
@section Installing a release

Simply download a release (from <https://dsemy.com/projects/swsw>), and install
it:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/download/swsw-VERSION.tar RET}
@end table

@node Installing from the Git repository
@section Installing from the Git repository

Clone the repository and build the package archive:

@example
$ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~dsemy/swsw
$ cd swsw
$ make
@end example

Install the package:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/clone/swsw-VERSION.tar RET}
@end table

@node Usage
@chapter Usage

In order to use any feature of the package, @code{swsw-mode} must be enabled:

@table @asis
@cindex swsw-mode
@item @kbd{M-x swsw-mode RET}
You can also add @code{(swsw-mode)} to your init file, instead.
@end table

When @code{swsw-mode} is enabled, window IDs are shown as mode line
lighters of the form @code{<ID>} (by default, @xref{ID display}), and
@code{other-window} (@kbd{C-x o}) is remapped to @code{swsw-select}.

@table @asis
@kindex C-x o
@cindex swsw-select
@item @kbd{C-x o}
Start window selection (@code{swsw-select}).
This command sets a transient key map in which several window
commands are defined, and window IDs can be selected.
Selecting a window ID (by pressing @kbd{ID}) will switch to window
corresponding to it.

@kindex C-x o m
@cindex swsw-select-minibuffer
@item @kbd{C-x o m}
Switch focus the minibuffer if it's active
(@code{swsw-select-minibuffer}).

@kindex C-x o 0
@cindex swsw-delete
@item @kbd{C-x o 0}
Start window deletion (@code{swsw-delete}).
This command sets a transient key map in which several window
commands are defined, and window IDs can be selected.
Selecting a window ID (by pressing @kbd{ID}) will delete the window
corresponding to it.
@end table

@xref{Window commands} for information regarding defining new commands.

@node Customization
@chapter Customization

All customization, except for defining custom display functions and
custom window commands, can be done through the customize interface:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x customize-group RET swsw RET}
@end table

@defopt swsw-id-chars
Base set of character from which window IDs are constructed. This should be a
list of characters. By default, the home row (@code{a s d f g h j k l}) is
used.
@end defopt

@defopt swsw-scope
Scope of all window operations. Used to determine on which frames to track
windows. A value of @code{t} means consider all windows on all frames, @code{0}
(the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible and iconified
frames, @code{visible} means consider all windows on all visible frames and
@code{current} means consider only the currently selected frame. By default,
@code{t} is used.
@end defopt

@menu
* ID display::
* Window commands::
@end menu

@node ID display
@section ID display

By default, the ID of each tracked window is displayed as a mode line
lighter. This behavior is controlled by @code{swsw-display-lighter}.

Additionally, (custom) display functions could be added to
@code{swsw-mode-hook}. These functions should enable ID display when
@code{swsw-mode} is enabled, and disable ID display when
@code{swsw-mode} is disabled. They can also make use of
@code{swsw-before-command-hook} and @code{swsw-after-command-hook}
(see @xref{Window commands}) to display IDs only during window
selection. See the description and implementation of
@code{swsw-mode-line-display-function} and
@code{swsw-mode-line-conditional-display-function} below for more
information.

It is also possible to use @code{swsw-format-id} directly in
e.g. @code{mode-line-format}, although details vary depending on how
and where you want the IDs to be displayed.

@defopt swsw-display-lighter
Whether or not to show a mode line lighter. A non-nil value means show
a mode line lighter.  A value of @code{nil} means don't show a mode
line lighter. By default, @code{t} is used.
@end defopt

@defopt swsw-mode-hook
Hook run when enabling or disabling @code{swsw-mode}.
@end defopt

@defopt swsw-id-format
Format string for the window ID. Used in the mode line lighter, and
display functions may use this format string to display the ID, but
they can also ignore it. The string should contain a single occurrence
of @code{%s}, which will be replaced by the ID. By default,
@code{" <%s>"} is used.
@end defopt

@defun swsw-format-id window
Format an ID string (according to @code{swsw-id-format}) for WINDOW.
@end defun

@defun swsw-mode-line-display-function
Reference implementation of a ``simple'' display function, displaying
window IDs at the beginning of the mode line. Display window IDs if
@code{swsw-mode} is enabled, and disable displaying window IDs if
@code{swsw-mode} is disabled.  This display function respects
@code{swsw-id-format}.
@end defun

@defun swsw-mode-line-conditional-display-function
Reference implementation of a conditional display function, displaying
window IDs at the beginning of the mode line during window selection.
Add a hook to @code{swsw-before-command-hook} which displays window
IDs on the mode line and add a hook to @code{swsw-after-command-hook}
which hides window IDs from the mode line if @code{swsw-mode} is
enabled, and remove those hooks if @code{swsw-mode} is disabled.  This
display function respects @code{swsw-id-format}.
@end defun

@node Window commands
@section Window commands

Window commands are used to perform operations on specific
windows. They are normal commands (interactive functions) which are
bound to a key sequence in @code{swsw-command-map}. @code{swsw-select},
@code{swsw-select-minibuffer} and @code{swsw-delete} are implemented
as window commands.

@defvar swsw--id-map
Key map which is populated automatically with elements corresponding
to all tracked windows. The ID of each window is converted to a vector
(to serve as a key sequence), and corresponds to a command which calls
@code{last-command} with the window corresponding to the ID as the
sole argument. There should be no reason to modify it directly;
it is reset whenever window configuration is updated.
@end defvar

@defvar swsw-command-map
Key map which holds (usually) single character key bindings to window
commands. This key map is set as the parent of @code{swsw--id-map}, so
all window commands are available when it's active, unless they are
shadowed by a window ID.
@end defvar

@defvar swsw-window-count
Amount of windows currently tracked, including the minibuffer (if it's
active). It can be used to change the behavior of window commands (or
display functions, @xref{ID display}).
@end defvar

@defun swsw-run-window-command fun
Run FUN as a window command. Run @code{swsw-before-command-hook}, set
@code{this-command} to FUN, and set @code{swsw--id-map} as a transient
map which runs @code{swsw-after-command-hook} on exit. This function
can be used to easily define new window commands. The hooks ran by
this function are expected by swsw to run for any window command which
requires ID selection; they should be manually added even if this
function isn't used when defining a new window command.
