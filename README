swsw - simple window switching

DESCRIPTION

swsw is an Emacs package which provides a minor mode for switching windows
similarly to `ace-window'.

USAGE

When swsw-mode is active:
- a single character CHAR is added to the beginning of the mode line of each
  active window.
- Pressing M-x swsw-select RET CHAR switches focus to the window which
  corresponds to CHAR.

INSTALLATION

Currently, only manual installation is available:

1. Clone the repository:

$ git clone 'https://git.sr.ht:~dsemy/swsw'

2. Load the package and enable the minor mode:

;; vanilla

  :load-path "swsw/"
