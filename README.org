#+title: Devhelp - Browse documentation in Devhelp format

In this unfortunate world, many documentations are using various HTML based
format, instead of using the excellent Texinfo and Info format.  This makes
integrating of these manuals with Emacs hard, although not impossible.

This package make tries to integrate one of those stupid formats, Devhelp,
with Emacs.

* Usage

=M-x devhelp= and you are good to go.  But you use a system that isn't FHS
(Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) compliant, then you would need to change
it.  For example, you have to put the following in the init file for GNU
Guix:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq devhelp-search-directories
      '("/run/current-system/profile/share/doc/"
        "/run/current-system/profile/share/gtk-doc/html/"
        "~/.guix-profile/share/doc/"
        "~/.guix-profile/share/gtk-doc/html/"))
#+end_src

You can also bookmark pages, with the standard ~bookmark-set~ function.

* Installation

Devhelp isn't available on any ELPA right now.  So, you have to follow one
of the following methods:

** Quelpa

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(devhelp :fetcher git
                  :url "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-devhelp.git"))
#+end_src

** Straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(devhelp :type git :repo "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-devhelp.git"))
#+end_src

** Manual

Download the ~devhelp.el~ file and put it in your ~load-path~.
