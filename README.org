#+title: IWindow - Interactively manipulate windows

The default command for switching window in ~other-window~, which is
great for two windows, but unpredicatable and cumbersome when there
are more windows.  This package aims to solve that, by allowing to
select any window with a few keystrokes.

* Usage

Use ~iwindow-select~ to select window.  It is recommended to bind it
to somewhere, for example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") #'iwindow-select)
#+end_src

You can swap windows with `iwindow-swap'.  To delete a window, you can
use `iwindow-delete'.  And there is `iwindow-delete-others' to delete
all window except the chosen one.

* Installation

IWindow isn't available on any ELPA right now.  So, you have to follow
one of the following methods:

** Quelpa

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(iwindow :fetcher git
                  :url "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-iwindow.git"))
#+end_src

** Straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(iwindow :type git
           :repo "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-iwindow.git"))
#+end_src

** Manual

Download the ~IWindow.el~ file and put it in your ~load-path~.
