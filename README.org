#+title: ~gnu-indent~ - Indent your code with GNU Indent

Keeping code correctly indented can be tedious.  And when the project is
large, maintaining a consistent style everywhere by hand can become almost
impossible.  ~gnu-indent~ solves this problem by doing the job itself.
Enable ~gnu-indent-mode~ and continue with the your editing; your file will
be reindented by [[https://gnu.org/software/indent][GNU Indent]] just before saving it maintaining the position
of point.

GNU Indent supports C, C++ is also partially supported.
