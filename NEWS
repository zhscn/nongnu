swsw NEWS -- history of user-visible changes. -*- mode: outline -*-
See the end of the file for an explanation of the versioning scheme.

* 2.1.1

** Indicate that some functions are for interactive use only.

* 2.1

** Bump required Emacs version to 27.1.

** Update window information when switching frames.
This fixes several issues when 'swsw-scope' isn't set to t.

** Make 'swsw-select' and 'swsw-delete' respect 'swsw-scope'.
Previously, 'swsw-select' and 'swsw-delete' would not select/delete
the only other window if it was on a different frame and 'swsw-scope'
allowed tracking it.

** Remap 'other-window' to 'swsw-select' when 'swsw-mode' is active.
By default this changes nothing since the default binding for
'other-window' is 'C-x o'.
This change has been made to add (simple) out-of-the-box compatibility
with alternative key binding sets or different Emacs distributions
(provided they bind 'other-window').

* 2.0.2

** No user visible changes.

* 2.0.1

** Add a link to the info node in the customization buffer.

** Add version information to customizable variables.

** Fix 'swsw-delete' when the only other tracked window is the minibuffer.

* 2.0

** Add support for custom window management commands.
Binding a command to a key in 'swsw-command-map' allows you to call that
command instead of selecting an ID.
Currently three such commands are defined: 'swsw-select' (o),
'swsw-select-minibuffer' (m), 'swsw-delete' (0).

** Breaking changes

*** 'swsw-minibuffer-id' is no longer defined or used anywhere, instead
providing the same functionality through 'swsw-select-minibuffer'.

*** 'swsw-select' no longer accepts a window ID as an optional argument.

* 1.1.2

** Apply customization options immediately.
Customizing 'swsw-id-chars' and 'swsw-scope' and applying those changes now
causes all window IDs to update.

** Construct IDs without pre-computing all possible IDs.
This should hopefully help performance when dealing with a very large
number of windows.

** Fix the calculation of the ID length.
Previously the ID length reported was much bigger than it needed to
be.

** Prevent setting the minibuffer ID to a character which can be used to
construct a regular ID, and vice versa.

** Fix window selection occurring when entering an invalid ID.

* 1.1.1

** Bump required Emacs version to 26.1.

** Add missing license information in several places.
The info node was missing license information, and created archives were missing
the LICENSE file.

** Update the homepage of the package to dsemy.com/software/swsw.

** Update documentation strings.
Documentation strings for several functions and variables have been updated to
be more clear and to better comply with Emacs' conventions.

** Update installation instructions.
Installation instructions have been updated to indicate the possibility of
installing the package from GNU ELPA.
Note: at the time of writing this, this isn't actually possible yet, but the
instructions have been updated since I'm expecting this to be possible soon.

* 1.1

** Add the ability to customize the scope of 'swsw-mode'.
'swsw-scope' controls in which frames 'swsw-mode' tracks windows.

** Fix conditional display functions potentially breaking when the user presses
'C-g' ('keyboard-quit') while reading a window ID.

** Bind 'C-x o' to 'swsw-select' in 'swsw-mode-map' by default.

** Add an info node.
An info node (swsw) has been added which documents all user facing parts of the
package in detail.

* 1.0

** Add support for multi-character IDs.
IDs can now be constructed from multiple characters taken from 'swsw-id-chars',
when there are enough tracked windows.

** Add support for alternate display functions.
A new customization variable has been added: 'swsw-display-function'.
If it is set to a function, that function is used to display window IDs instead
of the mode line lighter.
See the documentation of the variable for more information.
Two reference functions are provided:
'swsw-mode-line-display-function' displays window IDs similarly to the way they
were displayed before version 0.3.
'swsw-mode-line-conditional-display-function' displays window IDs in the same way
but only when window selection is in progress.

* 0.3

** Add a sparse key map to 'swsw-mode'.
This allows creating key bindings which are only active when 'swsw-mode' is.

** Use a mode line lighter to show the window ID instead of adding it to the
start of the mode line.
The lighter is only displayed if the window is tracked by swsw.

* 0.2

** Switching to the minibuffer is now possible.
It is now possible to switch to the minibuffer (if it's active) by
pressing a character unique to the minibuffer window (default 'm').

** Use 'read-char' instead of 'read-char-from-minibuffer'.
'swsw-select' used 'read-char-from-minibuffer' with 'swsw-id-prompt'
as the prompt previously.
The new implementation doesn't show a prompt (so 'swsw-id-prompt' was
removed completely), and works on older Emacs versions.

* 0.1

** Initial version.

* Versioning scheme
swsw's versioning scheme is inspired by semver (https://semver.org/).
Each version number is of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (patch may be
omitted if 0).
The MAJOR version is bumped when a user facing variable or function
changes in a way that could cause previous user configuration to
break (where user configuration considered is configuration done
through the customize interface).
A MAJOR version bump is very unlikely.
The MINOR version is bumped when a feature is added in a non-breaking
way.
The PATCH version is bumped when no feature is added (e.g. a version
with only fixes, or changes to documentation).

Note that versions before 1.0 did not follow this scheme.
